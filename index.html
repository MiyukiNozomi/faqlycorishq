            <h3>My server is only accessible through IPv6.</h3>
            <p>I cannot guarantee that every single one who accesses this website even has access to the IPv6 internet, and therefore,
                hosting this page on my server would not only be a pretty bad idea (see answer of question Number 2) but also pointless.

            <h2>There are a few reasons for that, so lets just go through all of them, one by one:</h2>
            <h3>IPv4 is held together by duct tape and super glue.</h3>
            <p>
                You may have head of the term "NAT", stands for Network Address Translation, it's a method of 
                mapping one address space to another.
                IPv4 can support approximately 4.2 billion unique addresses, which may sound like a large number,
                but when you realize that there's roughly 11.3 billion devices connected to the internet as of 2021!
            </p>
            <h3>One-to-many NAT, the "duct tape".</h3>
            <div class="quotation">
                <p>
                    “The Internet has grown beyond anyone's expectations. Sustained exponential growth continues to introduce new challenges. One challenge is a concern within the community that globally unique address space will be exhausted.” 
                </p>
                <div class="author">– <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1918">RFC-1918, February, 1996</a>.</div>
            </div>
            <p>To free-up more IPv4s, RFC-1918 created what its known as "Private Address Space", or also "Local Network",
            essentially, now your house and every device on it is represented by a single public IPv4 address.
            and to make anything on your house accessible to the outside world you'll have to perform what's known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_forwarding">Port Forwarding</a>.
            Port forwarding, of course, is slower than just directly communicating with the server, but hey, it works!
            </p>
            <h3>IPv6, the future of IP.</h3>
            <p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">I</span>nternet <span style="font-weight: bold;">P</span>rotocol <span style="font-weight: bold;">v</span>ersion <span style="font-weight: bold;">6</span> 
            was originally showcased in 1995 (one year before RFC-1918), unlike IPv4's 32-bit addresses, IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses, technically allowing 2^128 IPs, the actual number is slightly smaller of course as some ranges may be reserved,
            but hey! that's a number so large that humanity might stop existing before we even exhaust that number of IPs!
            </p>
            <p>Without the need for NATs and port forwarding, the only thing stopping people from acessing your servers and machines is your firewall!</p>
            <h3>We screwed up.</h3>
            <p>This idea of private networks was created to be a short term duct tape to buy more time while deploying IPv6, however...</p>
            <p>ISPs simply began getting way too good in deploying NATs, to the point that today, ISPs are even placing their clients over 2 NATs!
                effectively making port forwarding impossible and requiring you to pay extra for a dedicated IP address for your house (which is my case).
                Nowadays NATs went from a short term duct tape to straight up super glue.
            </p>
            <h3>Why LycorisHQ will always remain IPv6-only.</h3>
            <p>For the future of the internet, <i>and because I'm a poor highschool student</i> LycorisHQ will only be available for the IPv6 internet, even if that means losing possible visitors.
            </p>
            <h4>But I really want to access that website!</h4>
            <p>Don't worry! you can use a tunnelbroker service to get access to the IPv6 internet, even if your ISP doesn't support IPv6,
            or, you can try contacting them.

            <h3>I know, you may know me as the "D programming language" guy, but hear me out</h3>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold;color:red">D</span> is a cool programming language, yes, but I preferred something more dynamic and more known for web-related stuff.
                So, I went with Node.js and TypeScript originally, until... well. I got bored of TypeScript.
            </p>
            <p>Haxe is a pretty cool language toolkit, and I have a lot of fun using it for web related stuff so, why not use it for my beloved website?
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>Fun fact: My mail server is actually written in TypeScript.</i>

            <h3>I have no idea</h3>
            <p>I don't know how it started, nor when it began, but early on my life, I was quite a fan of Naruto, nowadays I don't like it at all, and then I moved onto Angel Beats! and became whatever I am today.</p>
